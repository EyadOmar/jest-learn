## Video 1 - Introduction And Whats Unit Testing ?

- Unit testing, breaks down your code into small pieces, and tests each piece to make sure it works as expected.
- Unit testing is the responsibility of the developer, not the testing framework or the testing team.
- each tested section or piece of code is called a unit.
- testing can be done on: unit, modules, and procedures.
- unit is the smallest testable part of your code.
- common tools for unit testing in JavaScript are: Jest, Mocha, Jasmine, Karma and Tape.
- we need unit tests for couple of reasons:
  - Qualit of code
  - issues and bugs discovered earlier and easier
  - almot functionality documentation
- Top types of tests:
  - unit tests; as we disccussed testing specific part of the code or functionality
  - integration tests; testing the interaction between different parts of the code
  - end-to-end tests (e2e); testing the entire application, user experience, and user journey from start to finish
